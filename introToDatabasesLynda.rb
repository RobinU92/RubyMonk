=begin Introducing Databases

1 application   = 1 database
1 model         = 1 table

Column: a set of data of a single simple type
  1 attribute = 1 column
  
Row: a single record of data
  1 object or instance = 1 row
  
Field: the intersection of a column and a row
  Has a single value
  
Foreign Key: a table column whose values reference rows in another table
  THE FOUNDATION OF RELATION DATABESES
  
  Ex. subject_id located in the pages table would be the foreign key
  
Index: a data structure on a table to increase lookup speed
  Like the index at the back of a book

Schema: the structural definition of a database
  Defines the tables, columns, and indexes of a database
