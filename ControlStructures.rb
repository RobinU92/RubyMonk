#BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS IN RUBY

  #Beginners guide to Expressions in Ruby
  
  name == "Bob"     #checks if the variable name is equal to the string Bob
  age <= 35         #checks if the variable age is less than or equal to 35
  
  #Combining Expressions using && and || operators
  
  age >= 23 && name == 'Bob'                          #and Both conditions need to be true
  age < 14 || name == "Craig"                         #or Only one condition needs to be true
  age >= 23 && (name == 'Bob' || name == 'Jill')       
  
  #Negating expressions
  !(name == "Bob")                                    #any value for name will evaluate to true but Bob.
